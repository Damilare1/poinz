## Joining and leaving rooms

### Joining a room

You can join a room in three different ways

1. Visit the [landing page](https://poinz.herokuapp.com/) and click the big button *"Join new room"*. You will join a new room with a randomly assigned unique room id.
2. Visit the [landing page](https://poinz.herokuapp.com/), extend the form and enter a custom room name, then hit Enter or click the join button. If the room with this custom name (the room id) already exists, you will join it. Otherwise a new room is created.
3. Join a room directly by visiting the room url:  https://poinz.herokuapp.com/test   or  https://poinz.herokuapp.com/a-random-room-id-here. If the room with this name/id already exists, you will join it. Otherwise a new room is created.

### Leaving a room

You can leave a room by clicking the *leave* button in the top right corner. If you close your browser window or tab while you are in a room, other users will see you as "disconnected".

### Removing other users from the room

You can remove ("kick") other users from the room:

1. First click on the avatar of the user
2. Click on the *leave* button on the right to kick the user. If you click the *cross* on the left, you cancel the action and the user stays in the room.
